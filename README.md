# Cyber Crime Rates in Malaysia in 2017 and 2019

## Abstract
Cybercrime has emerged as a major global problem, posing threats to individuals, organisations, and the nation's cybersecurity. This summary presents an overview of cybercrime in Malaysia, including cyber harassment, content-related offences, intrusion attempts, fraud, malicious code, vulnerability reports, denial of service, and spam. The research investigates the incidence, trends, strategies, and consequences of various cybercrimes, emphasising emerging tactics utilised by Malaysian cybercriminals. Increased cyber harassment events, sophisticated attack attempts on important infrastructure, and economic losses due to cyber fraud are among the key findings. The report also examines the government's attempts to combat cybercrime through legal measures, law enforcement activities, and public awareness initiatives, giving policymakers and cybersecurity experts with insights into how to successfully handle these risks.

## Introduction
Cybercrime in Malaysia has emerged as a serious and developing menace in the digital era. With the fast development of internet access and technology use, the country has seen a surge in many types of cyber dangers, such as online fraud, hacking, identity theft, and cyberbullying. Malaysian authorities have taken attempts to address these difficulties through legislative measures and law enforcement initiatives, but cybercriminal activities continue to be a major concern, posing hazards to individuals, organisations, and the nation's broader cybersecurity environment.

## Methodology

### Model

#### 1. Data Preprocessing
Data preprocessing is a fundamental requirement for conducting reliable data analyses, especially when dealing with intricate building operations and potential data quality issues. It encompasses a range of methods aimed at improving the integrity of raw data, including the identification and handling of outliers and missing values (Cheng Fan, Meiling Chen, Xinghua Wang, Jiayuan Wang & Bufu Huang, 2021).

#### 2. Data Visualization
Data visualization involves the creation and utilization of computer-generated graphical depictions of data, encompassing the design and development of such representations. It serves as a powerful means to visually present data stemming from diverse origins, offering decision-makers the ability to perceive analytics in a visual format, facilitating data comprehension, pattern recognition, and informed decision-making (Matthew N O Sadiku, Adebowale E. Shadare, Sarhan M. Musa, Cajetan Akujuobi & Roy G Perry, 2016).

#### 3. Data Classification
Data classification refers to the deliberate decision-making process of assigning a sensitivity level to data during its creation, modification, augmentation, storage, or transmission. The classification of intellectual property should be driven by the degree of control and security required for the data, as well as its assessed value as a business asset (Craig Wright, 2008).

#### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory data analysis (EDA) stands as a crucial initial phase in any research investigation. Its primary objective involves scrutinizing the data for patterns, distributions, outliers, and irregularities, thereby guiding focused hypothesis testing. Additionally, EDA equips researchers with visualization tools to facilitate the comprehension and representation of data, aiding in the identification of inherent patterns, and aiding the analyst in recognizing natural data patterns (Matthieu Komorowski, Dominic C. Marshall, Justin D Salciccioli & Yves Crutain, 2016).

#### 5. Model Evaluation
Assessing the effectiveness of a developed predictive model, commonly referred to as model evaluation, holds a pivotal role within the realm of machine learning. This significance arises from the fact that the value of the model predominantly hinges on its estimated predictive capabilities. Model evaluation techniques not only serve as crucial tools for gauging the effectiveness of a trained model but also contribute significantly to the process of building the model in the first instance (Amin Zollanvari, 2023).

### Steps

#### 1. Excel Reader Node
This node reads data from an Excel file. It is the starting point of the procedure, where it will import the dataset.

#### 2. Column Filter Node
This node allows to choose certain columns or properties from the dataset. You may use it to remove extraneous columns from your analysis or modelling.

#### 3. Color Manager
The Colour Manager node is often used for visualisations. It lets you to apply colours to categories or groupings of data, which may be useful for constructing aesthetically pleasing and informative charts and plots.
